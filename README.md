# HealthFailureRiskAnalyzer
The Heart Failure Risk Analyzer is an R-based data science project that analyzes clinical patient data to predict the risk of death in heart failure patients. It includes logistic regression modeling, key visualizations, and outputs insightful probability distributions based on clinical features.

## 🚀 Features
- **📊 Data Analysis** of death events by risk score and age
- **📈 Logistic Regression Model** to predict death probability
- **🧠 Risk Prediction** based on age, ejection fraction, serum creatinine, serum sodium, and risk score
- **🎨 Visualizations** such as graphs and bar plots

## 💻 Technologies Used
- R (ggplot2, base R)
- Statistical Modeling: Logistic Regression (glm)
- Data Visualization: ggplot2

## 📁 Project Files
- `data/heart_failure_data.csv`: Source dataset
- `scripts/01_cleaning_data.R`: Data cleaning
- `scripts/02_visuals.R`: Reproduction of key visualizations and model
- `outputs/`: Folder containing generated graphs
